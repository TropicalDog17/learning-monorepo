# Learning Monorepo

This repo hosts a year-long roadmap (12 months, ~30 hrs/week) combining Rust distributed systems with zero-knowledge proofs.

## Getting Started

- Read the full roadmap: [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md)
- ZK track details and checklists: [zk-learning/README.md](./zk-learning/README.md)
- Talent Plan materials are vendored under `talent-plan/`.

## Structure

- `rust/`, `cryptography/`, `talent-plan/`: existing projects and materials
- `zk-projects/`: concrete ZK apps (circuits, verifiers, UIs)
- `zk-learning/`: the detailed ZK learning plan integrated with the roadmap

## Notes

- The roadmap is now 12 months. Earlier 6-month milestones have been expanded to include Q3â€“Q4 topics (recursion, identity, zk integrations, auditing, protocol literacy, capstone).
